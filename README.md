# ADVENT OF CODE
> Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like.

*[adventofcode.com/about](https://adventofcode.com/about)*

If you haven't tried these yet, I would highly recommend to give these a go!

&nbsp;

I'll be posting general solutions to all (or at least as many as I can) puzzles with explanations and comments.

My goal is that you can copy the code into any online PHP-compiler, adjust to your input-data, press run and get the correct answer immediately (more or less).

I strive to write code that completes both parts in less than a second.

There will always be some puzzles with edge-cases that my code doesn't cover. If you find any, please let me know!
